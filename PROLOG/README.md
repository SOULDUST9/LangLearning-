# Prolog

This folder contains basic programs and logic puzzles written in Prolog as part of my journey to learn declarative programming and logic-based problem solving.

## Purpose  
To understand the fundamentals of logic programming by exploring Prolog syntax, rules, and query-based reasoning.

## Topics Covered or Soon to be
- Facts and rules  
- Queries and unification  
- Recursion and backtracking  
- Lists and pattern matching  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Control predicates (`cut`, `fail`, etc.)  
- Logic puzzles (family trees, Sudoku, etc.)

## How to Run

1. Install a Prolog interpreter (e.g., [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/))  
2. Open a terminal or the SWI-Prolog interface  
3. Load your `.pl` file: ?- [filename].
