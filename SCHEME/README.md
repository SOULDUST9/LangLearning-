# Scheme

This folder contains practice programs and exercises written in Scheme as part of my exploration of functional programming and Lisp dialects.

## Purpose  
To learn fundamental Scheme concepts and build proficiency in recursive and functional programming styles.

## Topics Covered or Soon to be 
- Basic syntax and expressions  
- Defining functions (`define`, `lambda`)  
- Recursion and tail recursion  
- Conditionals (`if`, `cond`)  
- List operations (`car`, `cdr`, `cons`, `append`)  
- Higher-order functions  
- Simple symbolic computation

## How to Run

1. Install a Scheme interpreter such as [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) or MIT Scheme.  
2. Open your interpreter or command line.  
3. Load your `.scm` file, for example: racket filename.scm
