# Scheme Assignment

This project contains Scheme code written as part of a course assignment focusing on fundamental concepts of functional programming.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment involves solving problems using core Scheme features such as recursion, list processing, and conditional logic. Each function demonstrates how declarative logic and functional constructs can be used to solve computational problems.

## Topics Covered

- Function definitions with `define` and `lambda`  
- Recursive problem-solving  
- List manipulation using `car`, `cdr`, `cons`, and `append`  
- Conditional expressions using `if` and `cond`
