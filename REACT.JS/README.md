# Node.js Projects

This folder contains various **Node.js** and **React** mini-apps created for learning, testing, and building backend/frontend functionality.

## 📁 Structure

Each project will typically include:
- `index.js` – The main entry point (server or app logic)
- `App.js` – Main component logic (for React apps)
- `public/` – Contains `index.html` and any static assets
- `src/` – Source files for React projects
- `styles.css` – Optional styles for UI elements (if used)
- `package.json` – Defines project dependencies and scripts

## 🧠 What It Does

These projects demonstrate how to:
- Set up and run Node.js servers
- Build simple React frontends
- Use Express to serve static files or APIs
- Experiment with real-time communication (e.g., Socket.IO)
- Combine backend and frontend logic for small web apps

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
