# My Feed Page

A simple HTML and CSS layout simulating a personal social feed. Includes a profile image and a list of posts with images and text captions.

## 🧱 Features

- Circular profile image at the top  
- Post list with images, captions, and hashtags  
- Structured using semantic HTML (`ul`, `li`, `div`, `p`)  
- Easily extendable for more posts  

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – Main structure  
- `styles.css` – Styling for profile image and post layout  

## 💡 Styling Highlights

- `#top-img` uses `border-radius` for a circular profile photo  
- `margin: auto` and `display: block` centers the image  
- `.post-wrapper` wraps post image and text neatly  
- Basic styling can be enhanced with flexbox or media queries  

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser  
2. Replace placeholder post content or add more `<li>` blocks inside `#post-list`  
3. Customize styles in `styles.css` as needed
