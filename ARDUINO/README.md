# Arduino

This folder contains basic projects and sketches written for the Arduino platform as part of my electronics and embedded systems learning journey.

## Purpose  
To explore Arduino programming, hardware interaction, and sensor integration through hands-on experiments.

## Topics Covered or Soon to be
- Digital and analog I/O  
- Sensors and actuators  
- Serial communication  
- Timing and delays  
- PWM and analogWrite  
- Using external libraries  
- Simple automation projects

## How to Run

1. Open the **Arduino IDE**
2. Connect your Arduino board via USB  
3. Open the `.ino` file of the project you want to run  
4. Select the correct board and port from **Tools > Board** and **Tools > Port**  
5. Click the **Upload** button (right arrow icon) to upload the code to your board

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE (download from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
- Arduino-compatible board (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano)
- USB cable for programming
- Relevant sensors/actuators depending on the project

## Structure

Each subfolder contains:
- A `.ino` file with the Arduino code
- A `README.md` (optional) explaining the project
- Any additional files (e.g., wiring diagrams, images, libraries)

## Notes

Make sure to install any required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager. Some projects may require additional hardware or modules.
